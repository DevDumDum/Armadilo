1. The DSARV prototype system was constructed and developed using the project designs proposed.
2. The DSARV prototype system was evaluated, and it has proven its acceptability by its evaluators.
3. The DSARV prototype system has undergone multiple test procedures to test the functionality of the system.
4. The current system findings proved that the system hardware with its GUI, is capable of giving a robot arm an automated classification and segregation process with a minimal supervision.
